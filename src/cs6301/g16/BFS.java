/**
 * <h1>Fall 2017 Short Project 1</h1>
 * <p>
 * Implement breadth-first search (BFS), and solve the problem of finding the diameter of a tree
 * that works as follows: Run BFS, starting at an arbitrary node as root. Let u be a node at maximum
 * distance from the root. Run BFS again, with u as the root. Output diameter: path from u to a node
 * at maximum distance from u.
